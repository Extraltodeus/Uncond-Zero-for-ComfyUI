# Uncond-Zero-for-ComfyUI

Allows to sample without generating any negative prediction with Stable Diffusion!

EDIT: WIP / update

# How to use:

Set your sampler CFG at 1

## Tips:

- Nodes like the self-attention guidance making use of the uncond will not work.
- Combined with Tensort_RT you will reach new heights in terms of speed!
- I wouldn't be against [some support!](https://www.patreon.com/extraltodeus) :)
